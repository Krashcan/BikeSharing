## General Information
- This project was undertaken in the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which has significantly impacted the revenues of bike-sharing companies like BoomBikes. 
- The aim is to predict the demand for shared bikes post-pandemic, helping the company to prepare and strategize for the recovery phase.
- The business problem addressed is the need for BoomBikes to understand the factors affecting the demand for shared bikes in the American market, to better meet customer expectations and enhance profitability.
- The dataset used includes daily data on bike rentals across the American market, covering various factors like weather conditions, day of the week, and user type (casual or registered).

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Our analysis identified several significant predictors for the demand for shared bikes, including weather conditions, year, temperature etc..
- We found that the demand for bikes is increasing annually, highlighting the importance of the 'yr' variable in our model.
- Weather conditions and seasonality play critical roles in determining the demand for shared bikes.
- The model successfully predicts bike rental demand with a high degree of accuracy, as evidenced by an R-squared score of 80.3% on the test set.
